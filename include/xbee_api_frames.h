/**
 * @enum xbee_deliveryStatus_t
 * @brief Delivery status codes for XBee Transmit Status frames (0x89).
 *
 * This enumeration defines the possible delivery status codes that can be 
 * returned in the Transmit Status frame (0x89) by the XBee module. These codes 
 * indicate the result of a data transmission, helping to determine whether the 
 * transmission was successful or if an error occurred.
 *
 * The status codes can be used to troubleshoot issues in communication by 
 * identifying the specific reason for a transmission failure.
 *
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_SUCCESS
 *     Indicates that the transmission was successful. The packet was delivered to 
 *     the intended recipient without any errors.
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_NO_ACK
 *     Indicates that no acknowledgment was received from the recipient. This 
 *     typically means that the packet was not successfully received or acknowledged.
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_CCA_FAILURE
 *     Indicates a Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) failure. The XBee module was 
 *     unable to transmit because the channel was not clear (e.g., due to interference).
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_PURGED
 *     Indicates that the transmission was purged from the queue and not sent. This 
 *     may occur if the module was unable to transmit the packet within the allowed 
 *     timeframe.
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_INVALID_DEST
 *     Indicates that the destination endpoint was invalid. The packet could not be 
 *     delivered because the specified destination was not valid.
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_NET_ACK_FAILURE
 *     Indicates a network acknowledgment failure. The packet was not acknowledged 
 *     at the network level, suggesting that it was not delivered successfully.
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_NOT_JOINED
 *     Indicates that the module is not joined to a network. Transmission failed 
 *     because the XBee module is not part of a network.
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_SELF_ADDRESSED
 *     Indicates that the transmission was attempted to the module's own address, 
 *     which is not allowed.
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND
 *     Indicates that the destination address was not found. The XBee module could 
 *     not find the specified address in the network.
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_ROUTE_NOT_FOUND
 *     Indicates that no route to the destination was found. The module could not 
 *     find a valid path to the destination address within the network.
 * @var XBEE_DELIVERY_STATUS_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE
 *     Indicates that the payload was too large for transmission. The size of the 
 *     data exceeded the maximum allowed payload size for the XBee module.

 * @enum xbee_api_frame_type_t
 * @brief Enumeration of XBee API frame types.
 *
 * This enumeration defines the various API frame types used in XBee communication.
 * API frames are structured data packets that facilitate communication between the
 * host (e.g., microcontroller) and the XBee module. Different frame types serve
 * different purposes, such as sending commands, receiving data, controlling GPIOs,
 * or reading ADC values.
 *
 * The frame types are divided into common frames, specific frames for XBee LR,
 * XBee 3 RF, XBee Cellular, and GPIO/ADC-related frames.
 *
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_AT_COMMAND
 *     Frame type for sending AT commands to the XBee module. The command is executed
 *     locally by the module.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_TX_REQUEST
 *     Frame type for transmitting data to another device in the network. This frame
 *     initiates the transmission of a data packet.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_MODEM_STATUS
 *     Frame type that reports the status of the modem (e.g., hardware reset, network join).
 *     This frame is automatically generated by the XBee module.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_AT_RESPONSE
 *     Frame type for receiving the response to a previously sent AT command. It contains
 *     the result of the command execution.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_TX_STATUS

 *     frame provides feedback on whether the transmission was successful or failed.
 *
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_LR_JOIN_REQUEST

 *     initiates the transmission of a data packet within the LoRaWAN.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_LR_RX_PACKET
 *     Frame type specific to XBee LR modules for receiving data packets from the LoRaWAN network.
 *     This frame carries the payload received from another device.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_LR_EXPLICIT_RX_PACKET
 *     Frame type specific to XBee LR modules for receiving explicitly addressed data packets
 *     from the LoRaWAN network. It provides additional addressing information with the payload.
 *
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_3RF_REMOTE_AT_COMMAND
 *     Frame type specific to XBee 3 RF modules for sending remote AT commands to another
 *     device in the network. This allows configuration of remote devices.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_3RF_REMOTE_AT_RESPONSE
 *     Frame type specific to XBee 3 RF modules for receiving responses to remote AT commands.
 *     It contains the result of the remote command execution.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_3RF_RX_PACKET
 *     Frame type specific to XBee 3 RF modules for receiving data packets from another device
 *     in the network. This frame carries the received payload.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_3RF_RX_EXPLICIT_PACKET
 *     Frame type specific to XBee 3 RF modules for receiving explicitly addressed data packets.
 *     It includes addressing information along with the received payload.
 *
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_CELLULAR_TX_IPV4
 *     Frame type specific to XBee Cellular modules for transmitting IPv4 data packets. It initiates
 *     the transmission of an IPv4 packet over the cellular network.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_CELLULAR_RX_IPV4
 *     Frame type specific to XBee Cellular modules for receiving IPv4 data packets. It carries
 *     the received IPv4 packet from the cellular network.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_CELLULAR_MODEM_STATUS
 *     Frame type specific to XBee Cellular modules that reports the status of the cellular modem,
 *     including network registration, signal strength, and other modem status information.
 *
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_IO_DATA_SAMPLE_RX
 *     Frame type for receiving IO data samples. This frame contains the values read from the 
 *     GPIOs and ADCs of the remote XBee module.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_REMOTE_AT_COMMAND
 *     Frame type for sending remote AT commands related to GPIO/ADC configuration or control. 
 *     This allows configuration of remote XBee modules.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_REMOTE_AT_RESPONSE
 *     Frame type for receiving responses to remote AT commands related to GPIO/ADC configuration
 *     or control. It contains the result of the command execution.
 * @var XBEE_API_TYPE_IO_SAMPLE_RX_INDICATOR
 *     Frame type for receiving IO samples with explicit addressing. This frame includes
 *     GPIO and ADC readings from a specific XBee module and additional addressing information.

 * @struct xbee_api_frame_t
 * @brief Structure to represent an XBee API frame.
 *
 * This structure is used to represent an XBee API frame, which is a structured data packet 
 * exchanged between the host (e.g., microcontroller) and the XBee module. An API frame 
 * contains a specific type, a length field, a checksum for data integrity, and the actual 
 * frame data.
 *
 * XBee API frames are used for various communication tasks, including sending commands, 
 * transmitting data, receiving status information, and controlling IO pins. Each field 
 * in this structure serves a specific purpose in constructing and interpreting these frames.
 *
 * @var xbee_api_frame_t::type
 *     The type of the API frame, represented by the `xbee_api_frame_type_t` enumeration. 
 *     This field indicates the purpose of the frame, such as whether it is an AT command, 
 *     a data transmission, or a status report.
 * @var xbee_api_frame_t::length
 *     The length of the frame data, excluding the start delimiter, length bytes, and checksum.
 *     This field specifies the size of the data portion of the frame, helping in parsing and 
 *     processing the frame.
 * @var xbee_api_frame_t::checksum
 *     The checksum of the API frame, used to verify the integrity of the frame data. 
 *     The checksum is calculated over the frame's data and is essential for detecting 
 *     transmission errors.
 * @var xbee_api_frame_t::data
 *     The actual data contained within the API frame. This array holds the payload or 
 *     command data associated with the frame type. The size of this array is defined by 
 *     `XBEE_MAX_FRAME_DATA_SIZE`, which should be set according to the maximum expected 
 *     frame size in the application.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * @code
 * xbee_api_frame_t frame;
 * frame.type = XBEE_API_TYPE_TX_REQUEST;
 * frame.length = 10;
 * frame.data[0] = 0x01; // Example payload data
 * frame.checksum = calculateChecksum(frame.data, frame.length);
